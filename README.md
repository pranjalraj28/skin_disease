Autoimmune Skin Disease Detection Model
Project Description
This project implements a deep learning model for detecting autoimmune skin diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), leveraging the ResNet architecture. The model has been fine-tuned and tested on both ResNet-9 and ResNet-34, achieving high accuracy and recall. A user-friendly web interface, powered by Gradio, allows users to upload skin images and get real-time predictions. Additionally, the interface includes a trained chatbot for interactive user support, providing helpful information about skin diseases.
